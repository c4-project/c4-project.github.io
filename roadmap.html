                    Suggestion: consider expanding C4 to handle other languages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The main thing that would need to change is c4f's output
                    code, which targets a sort-of Litmus/C creole (that both
                    Litmus7 and c4f-c know how to turn into C), and may need
                    teaching to target new languages.
                    See <a href="#delitmus">'Beyond Litmus'</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another thing to bear in mind here is that c4f internally
                    uses a language called 
                    <a href="https://github.com/c4-project/c4f/tree/master/lib/fir">FIR</a>,
                    effectively an ad-hoc C subset with metadata tags and tree
                    simplifications.  This means that any support c4f has for
                    output languages needs to fit in the confines of FIR.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Possible other languages include:
                </p>

                    <dd>
                        Supporting a subset of C++ that aligns well to c4f's
                        internal language (FIR) would be relatively
                        straightforward, and would immediately pay off with
                        support for compilers such as MSVC which at time of
                        writing do not support C atomics.  Both C and C++ likely
                        trigger the same codepaths in compilers, though, so this
                        won't greatly improve compiler coverage.

                    <dt>C++ with transactional extensions</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Both c4f's internal language (FIR) and external
                        Litmus/C output have some support for C++ transactions,
                        as we considered supporting them at one point.  The
                        support didn't get finished (partly because it would
                        imply the same changes needed for targeting C++), and
                        at time of writing only GCC seems to support C++
                        transactions, but if this situation changes in the
                        future then transactional extensions may be interesting
                        to target.

                    <dt>OpenCL</dt>
                    <dd>
                        OpenCL's concurrency model is fairly similar to C's,
                        with additional workgroup partitioning we could
                        introduce into FIR.  OpenCL compilers are arguably more 
                        likely to exhibit bugs than C compilers.  Running tests
                        may require some engineering to replace Litmus with an
                        OpenCL kernel runner.

                    <dd>
                        Rust targets LLVM, and therefore a lot of LLVM's atomics
                        set-up, but its use of ownership, move semantics, and
                        'fearless concurrency' make it an interesting possible
                        target.  Looking into Rust-on-Cranelift rather than
                        Rust-on-LLVM may be interesting.

                    that don't fit easily

                    Examples include:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        compound data types (structs, unions, complexes);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        non-thread functions;

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        returns and other not-quite-Litmus-safe control flow
                        types.

                </ul>

                <p>
                    Many of these have appeared in concurrency-related bug
                    reports, and we would like to investigate them (eg. by
                    adding support for generating them to c4t), but they don't
                    fit well into the Litmus/C format used in almost every
                    stage of the pipeline.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another area where we may need to break with Litmus
                    compatibility is

                        Suggestion 1: make C4 carry proprietary Litmus extensions

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We could extend C4's Litmus/C language such that, while it
                        remains compatible with input from Memalloy, it has
                        extensions to capture some of the features above.  This
                        would break compatibility with Litmus7, and so we might
                        need to add a shim layer that addresses the
                        incompatibility or
                        <a href="#backends">target a different backend</a>.

                    <p>
                        c4f already has a rudimentary 'delitmus' command that
                        converts Litmus/C to C with auxiliary information
                        condensed into a separate machine-readabler file.  This
                        could be a good starting point for negotiating between
                        an extended Litmus/C and backends.

                    <p>
                        A more extreme approach might be to decouple FIR from
                        Litmus completely, and have c4f take something else as
                        its main test input and output.  This might be a good
                        approach, but would require conversion from Memalloy
                        output (or Memalloy support).

                <p class="hypothesis">
                    Hypothesis: c4f stresses compilers, but would be more useful
                    if it stressed their concurrency support in a more targeted
                    manner. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    A cheap and easy way of improving C4 is to add more actions
                    to c4f.  While this requires some programming against c4f's
                    deep module soup, it is an almost endless source of novelty
                    and potential bug finding.

                    <p>
                        Almost all of c4f's actions at time of writing are
                        either control-flow related (which, perversely, are not
                        too bad at finding control-flow bugs!) or introduce
                        atomic actions in redundant or sequentially-minded
                        patterns.  There is a lack of actions that actually
                        graft in atomic action patterns that perform meaningful
                        if semantically redundant communication between
                        threads.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For instance, we could introduce a pattern whereby
                        a thread is set to spin on a generated variable that is
                        then changed in another thread.  Failure to perform the
                        change would cause the thread to spin forever.  (This
                        would, however, manifest as a run timeout rather than a
                        flagged result, and so is probably not a useful pattern
                        in the current C4 setup where run timeouts are not
                        always indicative of errors).

                <p>
                    At time of writing, c4t supports testing via litmus7 only;
                    while it has basic understanding of how to use simulators
                    such as herd7 and RMEM, they aren't fully wired into its
                    testing workflow (mainly because they require more set-up
                    than just handing
                    litmus tests to a program).
                    Supporting other backends would have several advantages:

                    <li>
                        Adding simulators to c4t would allow for a trade-off
                        between exhaustiveness and freedom from machine quirks
                        on the one hand, and higher turnaround and possibly
                        greater ISA coverage on the other.

                    <li>
                        Non-Litmus7 simulators may be more amenable to accepting
                        test-cases that go beyond the usual Litmus test format.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other backends may have useful features, such as partial
                        results collection or running for a particular amount
                        of time rather than iterations, that improve throughput
                        or resilience.

                        differential testing.

                    c4t <em>does</em> have some progress towards a multi-backend
                    setup:

                    <li>
                        Backend jobs can specify input and output targets (eg,
                        maps Litmus/C to C, or C to assembly Litmus, etc.), but
                        most parts of c4t still hardcode in an expectation that
                        we map from Litmus/C to executables.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A backend for running c4f's delitmusifier exists, which
                        could be useful if c4t learned how to chain backends
                        (so, it could chain the delitmusifier onto another
                        backend that expects C).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="suggestion">
                    Suggestion: support more backends.

                <p>
                    Some backends that might be nice to support include:

                        Also a simulator for Litmus tests; seems more
                        constrained in which ISAs are supported, but supports
                        much more of each.  We have experimented with using RMEM
                        to test with c4f and Memalloy manually, but didn't get
                        far; there will still need to be some sanitisation of
                        the output of compilers, loop unrolling etc.
                        Consider exploring RMEM's ELF input support.

                        time of writing, it's not as good at litmus7 for
                        exploring weak behaviour, nor is it under any semblance
                        of active or officially sanctioned behaviour.  That
                        said, it's mentioned on this roadmap in case it could be

                <p class="hypothesis">
                    Hypothesis:
                    Throughput is important because of the nondeterministic
                    nature of both fuzzing and concurrency bugs, and C4's
                    throughput can be improved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a research project, C4 has not been designed with
                    throughput in mind (except for the high degree of
                    parallelism in c4t, and even then there is room for
                    improvement).

                        Rewriting, or at least re-architecting, c4f for
                        efficiency.  Currently, c4f is written in a very
                        pure/immutable-focused form of OCaml, and this likely
                        impacts its performance especially where things
                        construct, traverse, and tear down linked lists.

                        Bin-packing runs of concurrency tests such that, when
                        a test doesn't exhaust all cores, it can run in parallel
                        with another test.

                        machine node in c4t, such that the director can perform
                        set-up for the next test cycle while waiting for the
                        node to run the current one.

                <h2>Richer analysis</h2>

                <p class="hypothesis">
                    Hypothesis: It will always be the case that, when we write
                    C4 papers, we need analysis and statistics that C4 doesn't
                    yet support.
                </p>

                <p>
                    c4t has a lot of support for pulling out aggregate metrics,
                    statistics, saved tests, and other useful artefacts from
                    test runs.  This support has slowly accumulated over the
                    process of trying to write papers on C4, where we have
                    <em>always</em> found that we need more information about
                    tests than we have on hand.
                </p>

                <p class="suggestion">
                    Consider connecting c4t to a SQL database.

                        c4t

                </p>

                <p>
                    This is a heavyweight suggestion, especially since it
                    likely introduces either an external dependency or (for
                    SQLite) a C FFI dependency into c4t, but it is a highly
                    future-proof and efficient way of handling the problem of
                    needing rich analysis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Effectively, doing this would replace c4t's current JSON
                    file based statistics aggregation, and instead have such
                    requests be served by SQL queries on a database full of
                    test cycle information.
