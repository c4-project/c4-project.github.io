                <p>
                    <abbr title="C4 tester">c4t</abbr>
                    is a set of tools for running multi-machine, multi-target compiler tests.
                </p>

                <p>
                    c4t is designed for use with litmus tests fuzzed by
                    <a href="c4f.html">c4f</a> and compiled against
                    <a href="https://diy.inria.fr">litmus7</a>,
                    but support for other inputs and outputs is a wishlist task.
                </p>

                <p>
                    c4t is written in <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>,
                    and designed for quick cross-compilation and deployment of
                    the machine node.  Tests have been run successfully
                    on macOS (x86-64, AArch64) and GNU/Linux (x86-64, Arm,
                    AArch64, POWER), with the former three hosting the main
                    runner and dashboard.
