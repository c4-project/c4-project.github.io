                <h2>What is C4?</h2>
                <p>
                    C4 is a project to <em>check C compiler concurrency</em>.
                    The goal is to be able to find bugs in the way <em>real-world</em> compilers implement the C11 memory model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C4 contains four free and open-source (FOSS) projects:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://github.com/c4-project/c4f">c4f</a>,
                            a fuzzer for litmus tests;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://github.com/c4-project/c4t">c4t</a>,
                            an automatic runner for compiler test campaigns;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://github.com/c4-project/c4-corpora">c4-corpora</a>,
                            a set of Litmus tests pre-generated with
                            <a href="https://github.com/johnwickerson/memalloy">memalloy</a>;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://github.com/c4-project/c4-scripts">c4-scripts</a>,
                            a set of Bash scripts for automating some c4f and c4t
                            workflows.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Development on C4 was funded as part of the
                    <a href="https://interfacereasoning.com">Interface Reasoning for Interacting Systems</a>
                    project.
